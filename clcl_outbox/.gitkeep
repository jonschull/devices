# CLCL Outbox

This directory is used by cloud Claude instances to send messages to CLCL.

Files placed here trigger a GitHub Action that emails CLCL, waking it up.

## File Format

JSON files with structure:
```json
{
  "task": "Description of what CLCL should do",
  "priority": "normal|urgent",
  "from": "cloud-claude-session-id",
  "context": "Any additional context"
}
```

## Usage

Cloud Claude writes a file here, commits, and pushes.
GitHub Action sends email to claude@ecorestorationalliance.org.
CLCL wakes up and processes the task.
