## Call to Action

ERA v3 transforms from a map into a movement. Every feature should answer:

> **"Does this help someone take action on restoration?"**

- Practitioner → Start or improve a project
- Policy maker → Fund or legislate restoration
- Scientist → Research or validate impacts
- Citizen → Advocate or volunteer

**The map shows what's possible. The platform makes it happen.**
